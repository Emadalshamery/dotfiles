# Set a sensible default PATH:
#
# * /usr/local/bin is where Homebrew used to keep executables (before Apple
#   Silicon) â€” eventually this will be removed but keeping it here for compat
# * ~/.bin is where we can keep our own custom executables
#
# Why do we totally reset the PATH here instead of prepending to it? Because of
# tmux. tmux inherits from the parent shell's PATH. The parent shell has already
# loaded this file, but tmux will load it all over again. Therefore if we simply
# prepend, then PATH will explode and have a bunch of duplicates it. This causes
# issues with NVM such as this one[1] and nodenv as well.
