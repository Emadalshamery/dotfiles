" Configuration for vim-javascript
" ================================

" The vim-javascript plugin has built-in support for Flow. We simply need to
" enable it:

let g:javascript_plugin_flow = 1

" The plugin also has supported for highlighting JSDoc so we enable that too:

let g:javascript_plugin_jsdoc = 1
