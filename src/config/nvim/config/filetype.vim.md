# File type settings

Some types of files use different settings. Some files that have a certain
extension are incorrectly assigned the wrong file type. This file attempts to
address both of these issues.

To start with, most files use soft tabs, but Makefiles are different because
they literally do not work unless they have real ones:

``` vim
augroup local
  autocmd FileType make setl noexpandtab
augroup END
```

A lot of files that we use in the Ruby world don't end in `.rb`. This is
unfortunate, but it means they aren't highlighted like Ruby files, so we do
that:

``` vim
augroup local
  autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile {config.ru,Gemfile,Guardfile,Rakefile,Thorfile,Vagrantfile,Appraisals,Bowerfile,*.gemspec} set ft=ruby
augroup END
```

Haml Coffee is a version of Haml that uses CoffeeScript instead of ERB, and its
files end in `.hamlc`. Since they are mostly Haml files, we highlight them as
such:

``` vim
augroup local
  autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.hamlc set ft=haml
augroup END
```

For some reason, auto-indentation isn't enabled in Markdown files, so we
explicitly enable that:

``` vim
augroup local
  autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.{md,mkd,mkdn,mark*} setl ft=markdown autoindent
augroup END
```

JSHint and ESLint configuration files are JavaScript files, so they need to be
highlighted as such:

``` vim
augroup local
  autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead {.jshintrc,.eslintrc} set ft=javascript
augroup END
```

Python encourages you to use [PEP8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
and so we enforce that here:

``` vim
augroup local
  autocmd FileType python set softtabstop=4 tabstop=4 shiftwidth=4 textwidth=79
augroup END
```

In the event that we edit our crontabs, we ask Vimt o make a backup copy of
those files in a way that is compatible with `crontab -e`. In truth, I don't
know when I would do this, but I suppose that it's handy.

``` vim
augroup local
  autocmd BufEnter /private/tmp/crontab.* setl backupcopy=yes
augroup END
```

Usually, `.` is treated as a word boundary. So when using <kbd>w</kbd> or
<kbd>b</kbd> to navigate by word, the cursor will stop at a period. In text,
this makes sense, and in most programming languages, this makes sense too, as
dots are usually tokens. But in Clojure, dots denote namespaces. So `foo.bar`
means the `bar` function in the `foo` namespace. We want to treat this as a
single unit from a navigation standpoint, so we make that happen here.

``` vim
augroup local
  autocmd FileType clojure set iskeyword-=.
augroup END
```

Skim is Slim, but for JavaScript, and its files end in `.skim`. Since the syntax
looks just like Slim, we can borrow Slim's syntax highlighting:

``` vim
augroup local
  autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.skim set ft=slim
augroup END
```
