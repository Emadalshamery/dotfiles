" Line wrapping settings
" ======================

" This file concerns the behavior around soft wrapping and hard wrapping.
"
" Let's start with soft wrapping. We do not turn on soft wrapping by default as
" it tends to be annoying:

set nowrap

" But we do provide a way to turn it on with `,wi`:

map <Leader>wi :set invwrap<CR>

" Then we specify that when it is enabled, lines will be broken by word
" boundaries. To distinguish soft-wrapped lines from hard-wrapped ones, we
" indent those lines and put an indicator before them:

set linebreak breakindent showbreak="ï¼ž"

" These next mappings are important: they give us a way to navigate over wrapped
" lines by using the usual `j` and `k` (normally, we would have to use `gj` and
" `gk`):

nnoremap j gj
vnoremap j gj
nnoremap k gk
vnoremap k gk

" Now for hard wrapping. We can control this through `formatoptions`; the
" options we specify here signify the following:
"
" * `t`: This option tells Vim to use `textwidth` to wrap lines.
" * `c` / `r` / `o`: These options control how comment lines are wrapped.
"   Whether these lines are being wrapped automatically as we are typing them,
"   we insert a line break at the end of a line manually with Enter, or we add
"   new lines using `o` or `O`, Vim will ensure that the characters that start
"   the comment (`#`, `//`, `"`, etc.) are present at the beginning of the newly
"   added line.
" * `q`: This option allows us to format comments with `gq`.
" * `v` / `b`: These two options control how lines are auto-wrapped as we are
"   typing them. Usually, as you type, as soon as the current line exceeds
"   `textwidth`, a new line will be added and the word you're typing will be
"   placed on that line. These options say two things: 1) that the auto-wrapping
"   will occur when you type a space instead of immediately (so as not to be so
"   jarring) and 2) that if the line already exceeds `linewidth`, don't bother
"   with wrapping that line (again, so as not to be a surprise). This isn't
"   perfect -- oftentimes, you still end up having to select that line and wrap
"   it manually with `Q` -- but it works well for most cases.

set formatoptions=tcroqvb
augroup local
  autocmd FileType * setl formatoptions=tcroqvb
augroup END

" Finally, we provide a way to toggle hard wrapping with `,ww`:

let g:old_textwidth = 0
function! ToggleHardWrap()
  if &textwidth
    let g:old_textwidth = &textwidth
    let &textwidth = 0
  else
    let &textwidth = g:old_textwidth
  endif
endfunction
noremap <Leader>ww :call ToggleHardWrap()<CR>
