" Clipboard settings
" ==================

" By default, Vim uses its own clipboard. This is frustrating if you're copying
" code from one project to another or from the browser to your editor. We can,
" of course, get around this by using the `"` register when yanking and pasting,
" but it's simply easier to use the system clipboard every time:

set clipboard=unnamed
