# vimfiles

I use Vim daily. I made my own configuration. And here it is!

## Installation

Clone this repo, then run:

    git submodule update --init

Now run the install script:

    script/install --link

Finally, open Vim and run

    :NeoBundleInstall

You shouldn't have any problems doing this, but if you do, please [create an
issue][issues].

Finally, if you are using MacVim instead of Terminal Vim, you will need to
download "Droid Sans Mono for Powerline". You can get that
[here][powerline-fonts].

### How the install script works

The install script will copy over anything in src/ as a dotfile. That is,
src/vimrc is copied to ~/.vimrc, src/vim is copied to ~/.vim, etc. If a file
ends in .erb it will be evaluated as an ERB template and the resulting content
will copied to the dotfile (`@options` refer to the options parsed from the
command line). The script takes care not to overwrite any files, unless you
specify `--force-update` or `--force-all`. If you want to know what it will do
before running it for real, say `script/install --verbose --dry-run`.

## What's inside

Here's a rundown of (almost) everything my configuration does:

### Basics

* Use NeoBundle to manage plugins
* Show line numbers
* Show line/column in status bar
* Hide buffers when they are not displayed (vs. unloading them)
* Remove delay after pressing Escape and clearing the visual selection
* Use modelines and check 10 lines to read them
* Fix so typing '#' (which is a comment in CoffeeScript, and elsewhere) does not
  jump to the start of the line
* Enable per-directory .vimrc's

### Magic

* Auto-reload files that are modified outside of Vim
* Auto-source vim config when it's modified
* Remember the last location in an file when reopening it

### Colors

* Enable 256-color support
* Use mokolai color scheme (customized by yours truly)
* Set four color columns at 72, 80, 100, and 120 characters

### Whitespace

* Set tabstop to 2 spaces always; use tabs by default, but use spaces for
  file formats I personally use (Ruby, CSS, JavaScript, CoffeeScript, HTML, XML,
  Markdown, Haml, Shell, ERB, Sass, Vimscript, Stylus, Jade)
* Display invisible characters: tabs, spaces, and end-of-line
* Highlight trailing whitespace, but provide a way to trim whitespace manually
  (`<Leader>tw`)
* Change the color of leading tabs to a dark color so it's not so overwhelming

### Line wrapping

* Soft wrap lines
* For wrapped lines, `j` and `k` jump to the next row rather than the next
  actual line
* Don't insert two spaces, but one space, after joining lines
* Turn on most of the `formatoptions`:
  * Auto-wrap text
  * Auto-wrap comments
  * Auto-insert comment leader
  * Allow formatting of comments using `gq`
  * In insert mode, auto-soft wrap only if the line was less than the wrap
    length before you entered insert mode (otherwise you can use `Q` to wrap)
* `<Leader>ww` toggles hard wrapping (which is on by default)
* `<Leader>wi` toggles soft wrapping (which is off by default)

### Searching

* Show all matches when you search (use `Ctrl-\` to clear)
* Enable incremental search (when using `/` to search)

### Filetype-based configuration

* Ensure config.ru, Gemfile, Rakefile, Thorfile, Vagrantfile, Appraisals, and
  Bowerfile are all syntax-highlighted as Ruby files
* Ensure Haml Coffee files are highlighted as Haml files
* Ensure JSON files are highlighed as JavaScript files
* Make Python files follow PEP8

### Folding

* Enable folding
* Folding works according to indentation, and the max indentation level is 6

### Window

* New splits go below the current buffer, and also to the right

### Scrolling

* Always show at least 3 lines above/below cursor and at least 7 columns next to
  the cursor even when scrolling

### Cursor

* Use a line for the cursor (instead of a block) when entering insert mode under
  iTerm2, and also make sure this appears under tmux too

### Various mappings

* Map `%` to bounce from `do` to `end` in Ruby files
* Map `<Leader>evi` to open .vimrc, `<Leader>evb` to open .vimrc.bundles
* Map `F3` to easily toggle paste mode
* Map `Ctrl-{h,l,k,j}` to move between windows (left, right, up, down)
* Map `Ctrl-{e,t}` to move between tabs (left, right)
* Map `Q` to re-format the selection
* Map `Y` to yank to the end of the line (like `C` and `D`)
* No-op `K` as it doesn't do anything useful
* Map `Ctrl-S` to save, `Ctrl-Q` to save + quit
* Map `Ctrl-\` to clear the current highlight (no more typing `/asdf` or
  somesuch)
* Map `<Leader>tc` to close a tab
* Map `<Leader>p$` to paste and overwrite the rest of the line
* Map `<Leader>p>` to paste into the next line but keeping the same indentation
  level
* Map `<Leader>gqc` as a better way of reformatting comments which joins
  everything and then reapplies hard wrapping (so if `Q` doesn't work, try this)
* Map `<Leader>syn` to identify the syntax group at the cursor

### Plugins

#### NERDTree

* Map `<Leader>tt` to toggle the NERD tree
* Map `<Leader>tf` to open the NERD tree and then reveal the current file
* Close vim if the only window left open is a NERD tree

#### Ctrl-P

* Open at the top instead of the bottom
* Use Ag for searching so it's faster

#### FormatComment

* Map `<Leader>qc` to use the FormatComment plugin to format comments. (This may
  or may not work better than `<Leader>gqc`.)

#### IndentLines

* Use `Â¦` to show indentation levels. (This is more handy than you realize.)
* Set this token to a dark color so it isn't that noticeable

#### vim-coffee-script

* Don't highlight objects, brackets, curly braces, parentheses, or operators

#### Airline

* Show the Airline for all windows not just split windows
* Use Powerline symbols
* Tell vim to not show `-- INSERT --` in the status bar, as Airline already
  shows its own version of which mode you're in

#### splitjoin

* When splitting a line in Ruby that looks like `foo :x => 'y'`, don't
  add curly braces. (At least I think this is what this does)

#### vim-session

* Save the current session every 10 minutes
* When opening vim, open the current session if one has been saved
* Map `<Leader>ss` as a shortcut for `:SaveSession`
* Map `<Leader>so` as a shortcut for `:OpenSession`

#### vim-ruby

* Don't be so annoying with regard to indentation (using [my fork][vim-ruby])

#### vim-flavored-markdown

* Ensure that *.md and *.markdown files are highlighted as GitHub-flavored
  Markdown files and not regular Markdown files.

#### vim-slim

* Turn off smart indenting (I forget why now but it screws something up)
